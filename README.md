# LiquidBounce Add-on Template

A starting point for a [LiquidBounce](https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidBounce) add-on.

```

## Requirements

- JDK 25
- A LiquidBounce build to compile against (a published snapshot, or one you built yourself)

## Getting started

1. Click **Use this template** on GitHub, or `git clone --depth 1` this repository.
2. Rename things away from the example. There are eight places:

   | File | What to change |
   |---|---|
   | `settings.gradle.kts` | `rootProject.name` |
   | `gradle.properties` | `maven_group`, `archives_base_name` |
   | `src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json` | `id`, `name`, `description`, `authors`, the entrypoint class |
   | `src/main/resources/example-addon.mixins.json` | filename, and the `package` |
   | `src/main/resources/example-addon.accesswidener` | filename (and `loom.accessWidenerPath` in `build.gradle.kts`) |
   | `src/main/resources/resources/example-addon/` | folder name, which must match your add-on id, and the `icon` path |
   | `src/main/kotlin/com/example/addon/` | package name |

3. `./gradlew build`, then drop `build/libs/<your-addon>.jar` into your `mods/` folder next to
   LiquidBounce.
4. In game, `.addon list` should show it, and `.example` should answer.

## Targeting a LiquidBounce version

`gradle/libs.versions.toml`:

```toml
liquidbounce = "0.40.1+26.3-SNAPSHOT"
```

- `<version>+<mc>` for a release, from `maven.ccbluex.net/releases`
- `<version>+<mc>-SNAPSHOT` for the moving nextgen build, from `maven.ccbluex.net/snapshots`
- `<version>+<mc>-<sha>-SNAPSHOT` to pin one commit

To build against a local client, run `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` in a LiquidBounce checkout;
`mavenLocal()` is already in this template's repositories.

**Do not add a `mappings(...)` line.** LiquidBounce declares none either, and Loom defaults to
Mojang official mappings for this Minecraft version. A different mapping set produces an add-on that
compiles and then fails on every Minecraft call.

## What the example covers

- `ExampleAddon`, the entrypoint and its lifecycle hooks
- `ExampleCategories`, a custom ClickGUI category
- `modules/ModuleExample`, a `ClientModule` with settings and a tick handler
- `commands/CommandExample`, a Brigadier command
- `mixin/MixinExampleTitleScreen`, a Mixin into a vanilla class
- `resources/example-addon/lang/en_us.json`, translations merged into the client's language files

Client translation keys always win on collision, so an add-on cannot redefine a built-in string.

## Files your add-on ships

Everything goes into `src/main/resources/resources/<your-addon-id>/`: translations under `lang/`, the mod
icon, ClickGUI category icons (`ModuleCategory("Name", Identifier.fromNamespaceAndPath("<your-addon-id>", "clickgui/name.svg"))`).
Never use `assets/<your-addon-id>/`. Fabric registers every mod jar as a resource pack, so anything under
`assets/` becomes part of Minecraft's resources and could theoretically be used to detect LiquidBounce and
the add-on. The client reads its own `resources/` folder from the jar directly, which nothing else sees.

Everything marked `@AddonApi` in the client is stable between releases; the rest may change. For a
larger example, Kotlin and Java side by side and game tested, see
[LiquidBounce-Addon-Extras](https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidBounce-Addon-Extras).

## Publishing

A GitHub release pushes the jar to the LiquidBounce Marketplace. Create the add-on and an API token at
[liquidbounce.net/account/resources](https://liquidbounce.net/account/resources), then set both on the
repository under Settings, Secrets and variables, Actions:

| Kind     | Name                  | Value                              |
|----------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Variable | `MARKETPLACE_ITEM_ID` | the ID shown next to your add-on   |
| Secret   | `API_TOKEN`           | the token, it is only shown once   |

The build versions the add-on as `<mod_version>+<minecraft>`, e.g. `1.0.0+26.3`, so one version can be
released for several Minecraft versions. Tag the release with that version, `v1.0.0+26.3`: the tag becomes the
version on the Marketplace, the release notes its changelog, and the release fails when the tag and the jar
differ. Pre-releases are skipped. Uploads wait for review before clients see them, unless
the account is a trusted publisher.
